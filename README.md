# My Personalized Spending Analyzer

Hello and welcome to my spending analyzer tool! 

Within this project, I seek to better understand my personal spending habits. I started my first job in June of 2022 and have noticed my spending change dramatically since college. As a real adult I have a lot more responsibilites and expenses. During my undergrad years, my parents footed the bill for most of my spending but now rent and utilities are on my limited salary. 

I have also come to own a loving, adorable, and costly labradoodle named Rosco. I swear I spend more money on this dog than I do on myself. Rosco needs to be put on a budget lol. 

There are quite a few questions I would love to answer with this tool. Here are a few areas I might explore:
* What am I spending money on?
* How close am I to the 50/30/20 budgeting rule?
* Cost comparison: Rosco expenses / my expenses. Am I really spending more on my dog than I spend on myself? Or does it just feel like that?
* Am I spending too much on food?
* Am I spending too much on random purchases (home improvement, hobbies)?
* Can I afford my OTF membership?
* Do I have enough to start saving for a new car?

I will not disclose my salary or any of my transactions to this repo since I plan on sharing this project publically.
